 Instructions:

1. App Component:
Create the App component with a count state starting at 0.
Add a setCount function to update the count.
Pass count and setCount as props to child components.
Display Component:

2. Create Display to show the current count.
Inside it, add ShowCounter, which receives count as a prop and displays it.

3. Action Component:
Create Action to hold a Button component.
The Button will have an onClick handler that calls setCount 
to increase the count.
