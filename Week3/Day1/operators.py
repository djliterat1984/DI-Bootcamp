# Create a file called operators.py
# Create 2 functions : addOperator(x,y) that returns the addition of 2 numbers, and divideOperator(x,y) that returns the division of 2 numbers

def addOperator(x,y):
	return x+y

def divideOperator(x,y):
	return x/y

# Create another file called calculator.py, and import the operators module. Call the 2 functions and display the results

# Do this process 3 times :

# once by importing the whole module
# the second time by importing specific functions
# the third time by using alias
