Exercise 1 : Building a RESTful API with database connection
Instructions
You‚Äôre tasked with building a RESTful API for a blog platform.
Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete blog posts using different endpoints.

1.Create a directory named blog-api.


2.Inside the blog-api directory, open a terminal and run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project. Follow the prompts to set up your project.


3.Install the express package by running npm install express in the terminal.


4.Create a file named server.js.


5.In server.js, require the express package and set up an Express app.


6.Create a posts table in postgres database, with the properties like id, title, and content.


7.Implement the following routes using Express:

8.GET /posts: Return a list of all blog posts.
9.GET /posts/:id: Return a specific blog post based on its id.
10.POST /posts: Create a new blog post.
11.PUT /posts/:id: Update an existing blog post.
12.DELETE /posts/:id: Delete a blog post.


13.Create this directory structure:

server
    |_ config
    |_ controllers
    |_ models
    |_ routes


14.Implement error handling for invalid routes and server errors.


15.Start the Express app and listen on a specified port (e.g., 3000).



üåü Exercise 2 : Building a Basic CRUD API with database connection
Instructions
In this exercise, you‚Äôll build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Express.js. Your task is to create routes to manage a collection of books.

Create a new directory named book-api.


Inside the book-api directory, initialize a new Node.js project and install the express package.


Create a new file named app.js in the book-api directory.


In app.js, import the express module and create an instance of an Express app.


Define a basic data books table with properties like id, title, author, and publishedYear.


Create this directory structure:

server
    |_ config
    |_ controllers
    |_ models
    |_ routes


Set up the app to listen on port 5000. Print a message in the console to indicate that the server is running.


Implement the ‚ÄúRead all‚Äù route by defining a route at GET /api/books. Send a JSON response with the books array.


Implement the ‚ÄúRead‚Äù route by defining a route at GET /api/books/:bookId. Extract the bookId parameter from the URL and use it to find the corresponding book in the books array. If the book is found, send a JSON response with the book details and a status code of 200 (OK). If the book is not found, send a 404 status with a ‚ÄúBook not found‚Äù message.


Implement the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù route at POST /api/books.
