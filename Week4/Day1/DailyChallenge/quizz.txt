8.What is method resolution order or MRO?
MRO is a concept used in inheritance. It is the order in which a method is searched for in a classes hierarchy. This is important basically when class has multiple inheritance. First, the method is searched in the class of the object. If itâ€™s not found, it is searched in the immediate class declared. Example:  
def class C(B, A) ==> the MRO would be C -> B -> A.
